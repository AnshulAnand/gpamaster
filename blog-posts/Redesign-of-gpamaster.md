### **A New Start**

After the success of GPA Master during the odd semester of 2024, we have decided to redesign the platform completely with a much more modern design, more features and more resources, so that we can help even more students. GPA Master will provide not only resources this time, but also a platform for community building and valuable information.

#### **Community: Discussions**

GPA Master will provide a section for student community and discussion, where students can create and post any kind of doubts, share info, or just have discussions. With the ability to drop comments and express their opinions on those posts, we hope it will provide you with any kind of help.

#### **More Resources**

GPA Master will now provide subject wise resources, unlike previously where we provided branch-wise resources because different branches may have same courses or subjects. These notes or rescources are used and made by class toppers and 9 CGPA holders.

#### **Blog**

GPA Master will provide usefull blogs focused towards technology and student benefit. These Blogs will share any kind of usefull information, piece of advice or resources. We will try our best to add atleast one blog article each week.

We hope this new version of GPA Master, with a modern design, more features and resources for students, will provide any kind of help or guidance. We're continuously improving our platform. If you want to help GPA Master by contributing resources or submitting an idea, please feel free to contact on our email address: [officialgpamaster@gmail.com](mailto:officialgpamaster@gmail.com), we will contact you within 24 hours.
